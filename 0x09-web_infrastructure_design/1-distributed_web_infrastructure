* The whiteboard design is in img folder under the name 1-distributed_web_infrastructure.jpeg

* For every additional element, why you are adding it
    Load Balancer (HAproxy):
    Reason for Adding: Distributes incoming traffic to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed and provides redundancy.

* What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
    Distribution Algorithm: Round-robin, where requests are distributed sequentially and evenly across the servers.

* Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
    Setup: Active-Active for high availability and load balancing.
    - The difference between both
        Active-Active: Both servers are actively handling requests, providing high availability and load balancing.
        Active-Passive: One server is active and the other is on standby, taking over only if the active server fails.

* How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
    Primary Node (Master): Handles all write operations, ensuring data consistency.
    Replica Node (Slave): Handles read operations, reducing load on the primary and ensuring data is replicated for redundancy.

* What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
    - When a user updates their profile information (write operation), the application sends this request to the Primary node.
    - The Primary node updates the user's profile information and then propagates this change to the Replica node.
    - When another user views the profile (read operation), the application can send this request to the Replica node, thus reducing the load on the Primary node.

* Issues with This Infrastructure

    Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
        Load Balancer: If the load balancer fails, the entire system becomes inaccessible.
        Primary Database Node: If the primary node fails, write operations cannot be performed until a failover mechanism is initiated.

    Security Issues:
        No Firewall: Servers are exposed to potential attacks without a firewall.
        No HTTPS: Data transmission is insecure without HTTPS, making it susceptible to interception.

    No Monitoring:
        Without monitoring, there is no way to proactively manage system health, leading to potential undetected failures and performance issues.
