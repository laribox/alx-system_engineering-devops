* The whiteboard design is in img folder under the name 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.jpeg

* For every additional element, why you are adding it
   - Firewalls help to prevent unauthorized access to the servers by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
   - HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server, protecting it from interception and tampering.
   - Monitoring is used to track the performance and health of the infrastructure, detect issues, and alert administrators.

* What are firewalls for
    help to prevent unauthorized access to the servers by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
    encrypts the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server, protecting it from interception and tampering.

* What monitoring is used for
    used to track the performance and health of the infrastructure, detect issues, and alert administrators.


* How the monitoring tool is collecting data
    Monitoring clients installed on each server collect data on various performance metrics and send this data to a centralized monitoring service like Sumologic

* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
    To monitor QPS (Queries Per Second) on your web server, you would configure the monitoring client to track and report metrics related to incoming HTTP requests

Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:
        Issue: If SSL is terminated at the load balancer, the traffic between the load balancer and the backend servers is unencrypted, which can be a security risk if the internal network is compromised.

Single MySQL Server for Writes:
        Issue: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure for write operations. If this server goes down, no write operations can be performed.

Servers with All the Same Components:
        Issue: If each server runs the database, web server, and application server, it can lead to resource contention and complex maintenance. Scaling specific parts of the infrastructure independently becomes difficult.
