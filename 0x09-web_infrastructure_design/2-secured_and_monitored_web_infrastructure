* The whiteboard design is in img folder under the name 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.jpeg

* For every additional element, why you are adding it
   - Firewalls help to prevent unauthorized access to the servers by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
   - HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server, protecting it from interception and tampering.
   - Monitoring is used to track the performance and health of the infrastructure, detect issues, and alert administrators.

* What are firewalls for
    help to prevent unauthorized access to the servers by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
    encrypts the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server, protecting it from interception and tampering.

* What monitoring is used for
    used to track the performance and health of the infrastructure, detect issues, and alert administrators.


* How the monitoring tool is collecting data
    Monitoring clients installed on each server collect data on various performance metrics and send this data to a centralized monitoring service like Sumologic

* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
    To monitor QPS (Queries Per Second) on your web server, you would configure the monitoring client to track and report metrics related to incoming HTTP requests
