* What is a server
    A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers
    Role in Infrastructure: Our server, which has the IP address 8.8.8.8, hosts the web application, web server, application server, and database.

* What is the role of the domain name
    The domain name system (DNS) translates www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8

* What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
    The www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the IP address of the server (8.8.8.8)

* What is the role of the web server
     Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user's browser.

* What is the role of the application server
    The application server processes the request, interacting with the database if necessary, and sends the generated content back to the web server (Nginx).

* What is the role of the database
    Persistent data for the application

* What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
    The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol


* Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
        Since all components are on a single server, if this server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
    
* Downtime for Maintenance:
        Any maintenance, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server (Nginx), will cause downtime, making the website temporarily inaccessible.
    
* Scalability Issues:
        A single server setup cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic efficiently. As traffic increases, the server may become overloaded, leading to slow performance or crashes.
